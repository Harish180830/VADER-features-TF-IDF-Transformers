# Hybrid Sentiment Analysis using VADER, TF-IDF, Random Forest, and Transformers

## üìå Overview

This project implements a **high-accuracy sentiment analysis pipeline** by combining multiple approaches:

1. **VADER** ‚Äì Lexicon-based sentiment scoring, including emojis.
2. **TF-IDF** ‚Äì Captures domain-specific text features.
3. **Random Forest** ‚Äì Learns patterns from VADER + TF-IDF features.
4. **Transformers (DistilBERT)** ‚Äì Provides contextual understanding and acts as a tie-breaker in hybrid predictions.

The hybrid approach improves accuracy over **VADER-only** or **Random Forest-only** methods, while still being reasonably fast.

---

## ‚ö° Features

* Supports **product reviews**, **tweets**, or **social media text**.
* Handles **emojis**, negations, and informal language.
* Hybrid decision system combines classical ML + transformer predictions.
* Easily extendable to other transformer models for domain-specific tasks.

---

## üõ† Technologies & Libraries

* **Python 3.x**
* **Libraries:**

  * `vaderSentiment` ‚Äì Lexicon-based sentiment analysis
  * `transformers` ‚Äì Pretrained transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT)
  * `scikit-learn` ‚Äì Machine learning (Random Forest, TF-IDF, preprocessing)
  * `pandas`, `numpy` ‚Äì Data manipulation
* **Environment:** Google Colab or local Jupyter Notebook

## üìù Usage

1. **Clone repository** or open notebook in Colab.
2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install vaderSentiment transformers scikit-learn pandas numpy
```

3. **Load dataset** (`product_reviews_100.csv`) with `review` and `sentiment` columns.
4. **Run notebook**:

   * Extract VADER features
   * Generate TF-IDF features
   * Train Random Forest model
   * Use Transformers pipeline for hybrid prediction
5. **Test sample reviews**:

```python
sample_reviews = [
    "I love this phone üòçüî•",
    "This app is trash üò°üí©",
]
for review in sample_reviews:
    print(f"{review} => {predict_hybrid_sentiment(review)}")
```

## üìä Performance

* **Random Forest + VADER + TF-IDF**: High accuracy on domain-specific datasets.
* **Hybrid with Transformer**: Further boosts accuracy for sentences with context, sarcasm, or mixed sentiment.
* **Speed:** Faster than full transformer inference for large datasets because RF handles majority of predictions.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

* Replace `DistilBERT` with **domain-specific models** for better results:

  * Tweets: `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment`
  * Product Reviews: `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment`
* Adjust `TF-IDF max_features` to control dimensionality.
* Tune **Random Forest parameters** (`n_estimators`, `max_depth`) for performance optimization.

---

## üí° Notes

* The hybrid pipeline works best on **English text**.
* Emojis are preserved to retain sentiment information.
* For **real-time inference**, consider using **DistilBERT** or **batch processing** to reduce latency.

I can also generate a **ready-to-use `requirements.txt`** for this project so anyone can install all dependencies with a single command.

Do you want me to create that too?
